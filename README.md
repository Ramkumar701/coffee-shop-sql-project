# Coffee Shop Sales SQL Project

This project contains SQL queries used to analyze sales performance data from a coffee shop database. The data includes transactions with details such as product types, prices, quantities, dates, and times.

## Database Schema

Below is the schema for the coffee_shop_sales table used in this project:
```sql
CREATE TABLE coffee_shop_sales (
    transaction_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    transaction_date DATE,
    transaction_time TIME,
    product_category VARCHAR(50),
    product_type VARCHAR(50),
    unit_price DECIMAL(5,2),
    transaction_qty INT,
    store_location VARCHAR(50)
);
```
## Key Features

### Data Cleaning & Formatting  
  - Convert transaction_date and transaction_time to proper SQL formats  
  - Fix encoding issues and rename columns

### Sales KPIs  
  - Total Sales  
  - Total Orders  
  - Total Quantity Sold  
  - MoM (Month-over-Month) Growth and Differences

### 1.Total Sales
```sql
SELECT ROUND(SUM(unit_price * transaction_qty)) as Total_Sales 
FROM coffee_shop_sales 
WHERE MONTH(transaction_date) = 5 -- for month of (CM-May)
```

### 2.Total Orders
```sql
SELECT COUNT(transaction_id) as Total_Orders
FROM coffee_shop_sales 
WHERE MONTH (transaction_date)= 5 -- for month of (CM-May)
```

```sql
SELECT 
    MONTH(transaction_date) AS month,
    ROUND(SUM(unit_price * transaction_qty)) AS total_sales,
    (SUM(unit_price * transaction_qty) - LAG(SUM(unit_price * transaction_qty), 1)
    OVER (ORDER BY MONTH(transaction_date))) / LAG(SUM(unit_price * transaction_qty), 1) 
    OVER (ORDER BY MONTH(transaction_date)) * 100 AS mom_increase_percentage
FROM 
    coffee_shop_sales
WHERE 
    MONTH(transaction_date) IN (4, 5) -- for months of April and May
GROUP BY 
    MONTH(transaction_date)
ORDER BY 
    MONTH(transaction_date);

## Conclusion

This SQL project demonstrates how structured queries can be used to extract valuable insights from raw transactional data. By cleaning and transforming the dataset, and calculating key performance metrics such as sales, orders, and growth trends, we gain a deeper understanding of the coffee shopâ€™s business performance. 

These insights can be used to support data-driven decisions related to inventory, staffing, marketing, and operational efficiency. This project also lays a strong foundation for building interactive dashboards using tools like Power BI or Tableau in future stages.
